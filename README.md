"Passenger Counter App"
Liz Ferraro
July 5-6, 2022

### Notes: I deviated from the course when creating the "save" function and added a "Daily Total" log in addition to the "Previous Entries" log.

### How I will reinforce and apply these concepts: 

Project 01 "People Counter App": count the number of men, women, and children with totals for each and a total for all

Project 02 "Car Counter App": count cars by color and provide a total for each color and a total for all cars

Project 03 "Timeclock App": user to "clock in" and "clock out" and will record the time spent on task. There will be multiple tasks available to log time for in the dashboard. The app will also provide a total of all time logged over the duration of the task or project.
