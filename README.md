"Passenger Counter App"
Liz Ferraro
Date: July 5-X, 2022
Notes: I will apply what I learn from this course to build three projects: a "People Counter" app, a "Car Counter" app, and a "Timeclock" app. The people counter app will count the number of men, women, and children with totals for each and a total for all. The car counter app will allow the user to count cars by color and provide a total for each color and a total for all cars together. The timeclock app will allow the user to "clock in" and "clock out" and will record the time spent on task. There will be multiple tasks available to log time for in the dashboard. The app will also provide a total of all time logged over the duration of the task or project.
